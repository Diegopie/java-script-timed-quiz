# Java Script Quiz

This project was a way to practice manipulating DOM objects with Java Script. The objective was to dynamically load questions to the user. 

## Objective:

- Create a responsive website from scratch
- Generate new questions to the user as the click through their responses
- Notify the user if their response is wrong
- End the game when the timer hits zero or all questions have been answered

## Outcome: 

This project helped me to better utilize functions to streamline my code. I still have some ways to go to really understand the power of functions but I am happy with the results right now. There is definitely room for improvement in this code, particulary with how I load quesions to the page.



## Collaborators:

It should not go without saying that none of this is possible without the Bootstrap team.

I would like to thank Diana Shull, Christian Blswell, Alvin Clemins, and Clarrisa for brainstorming how to approach this project and collaborating with specific issues in our code.
